# Java RPGHeroes

This a Java console application using maven and junit to implement and test basic functionality for hero classes in an RPG style game.

Each hero can can equip items of either tyep Weapon or type Armor. Depending on the class of the hero, they can only eqiup specific items. Each hero has a set of attributes, based on the popular three stat system (strength, dexterity, intelligence). These attributes are then increased when the user levels up and their total attributes are increased when equipping armor.
